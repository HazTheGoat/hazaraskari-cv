                          It's not every day you come across a developer who
                          truly understands the importance of putting the user's
                          needs first. Hazar recognizes the value of this, has
                          the ability to see the bigger picture, and solves
                          challenges quickly and efficiently. For a UX designer,
                          collaborating with Hazar is a delight.

                          incredible mentor. He explained complex frontend

                          Hazar is the kind of developer you can only dream of
                          working with. In 9 out of 10 tasks on our backlog, he

                        <p>
                          One of Hazar's greatest strength is his ability to
                          communicate and explain complex concepts in a very

                          Hazar is an exceptional consultant—the kind that truly
                          embodies what it means to be a top-tier professional.
                          He's not only highly skilled in his craft, but he also
                          possesses strong people skills, which makes him a
                          full-fledged consultant in every sense.

                          His frontend expertise is second to none, and he has
                          an instinctive grasp of the field. But what's even
                          more impressive is how quickly he picks up new
                          technologies—he mastered Umbraco in no time and
                          consistently delivers under estimated timelines. More
                          than once, he's casually mentioned completing a task
                          in 10-20% of the expected time, wondering if that
                          could possibly be correct!

                        <p>
                          Hazar is also an excellent mentor—he's pedagogical,
                          clear in his communication, and understands exactly
                          what a client needs to hear, while always being open
                          about his own thoughts.

                          I genuinely love working with Hazar, and so does
                          everyone else.
