        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-2">Summary</h1>
        <p className="text-2xl">
          I am a front-end architect and JavaScript engineer with over 10 years
          of experience building scalable, maintainable, and high-performing web
          applications. My expertise lies in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and NX
          Monorepos, crafting solutions that streamline development, enhance
          performance, and improve user experiences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I have a strong business and sales mindset, often
          joining sales meetings and pitches as the technical expert, where my
          ability to bridge the gap between business needs and technology has
          been instrumental in securing deals. I excel at actively listening to
          customer requirements, translating their vision into not just what
          they ask for, but an enhanced, future-proof solution that exceeds
          expectations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have led and mentored development teams,
          architected large-scale enterprise applications, and worked across
          industries ranging from finance and energy to e-commerce and SaaS
          platforms. At Miros Group, I played a pivotal role in revamping
          architectures, optimizing performance, and leading teams. My time at
          Knowit saw me contributing to 15+ major projects for brands like Yara,
          BankAxept, Talkmore, and OBOS Banken, working with React, Angular, and
          CMS platforms like Episerver and Umbraco.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A key strength of mine is helping businesses make the right strategic
          technology choices. I have repeatedly guided customers in product
          direction, architecture decisions, and tech stack selection, often
          foreseeing and preventing costly mistakes before they happen. Whether
          it's choosing the right framework, scaling an application, or pivoting
          a product roadmap, I have helped companies avoid disaster and maximize
          success.
        </p>

          If you're looking for an experienced frontend architect, technical
          lead, or senior developer to help optimize your applications, scale
          your architecture, or advise on critical technology decisions, let's
          connect. I'm always excited about opportunities where I can create
          impact, drive innovation, and help businesses succeed.
